# NanoTerminal
For Tang Nano 20K, System Verilog </br>
Work in progress</br>
Video terminal over HDMI communicating over UART</br>
Video core is somehow working, in the IBM mode 3 style.</br>
On power up, video core render welcome message on screen.</br>
Recieving of serial data works
Passing comand to video core for rendering on screen not finished - workss</br>
Code is in mess now - new to HW</br></br>
Why?</br>
Its fun, and will help me uderstand HW level. Plan is "upgrade it" to custom computer system on FPGA after finishing.</br></br>
